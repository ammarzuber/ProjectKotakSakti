A data engineer is responsible for designing and building the infrastructure to store, process, and analyze data. This typically involves working with large datasets and using a variety of technologies, such as databases, big data platforms, and data warehousing tools. The goal is to make it possible for data scientists and other stakeholders to access and work with the data in a efficient and effective manner. In a company like KotakSakti that provides data solutions, a data engineer might be responsible for setting up and maintaining the systems that collect and store data from a variety of sources, as well as developing and implementing processes for cleaning, transforming, and enriching the data. They may also work closely with data scientists and other team members to help them understand and make use of the data.
